Description: The BayesDLMfMRI package performs statistical analysis for 
    task-based fMRI data at both individual and group levels. 
    The analysis to detect brain activation at the individual level is based on modeling the fMRI 
    signal using Matrix-Variate Dynamic Linear Models (MDLM). 
    The analysis for the group stage is based on posterior distributions of the 
    state parameter obtained from the modeling at the individual level. 
    In this way, this package offers several R functions with different 
    algorithms to perform inference on the state parameter to assess brain activation for both individual and group stages. 
    Those functions allow for parallel computation when the analysis is performed for 
    the entire brain as well as analysis at specific voxels when it is required.
